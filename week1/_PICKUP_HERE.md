## Work left from Sun, 12/9/2018

### Intro to R:

- Resume at [Hadley's Advanced R](https://github.com/msr-ds3/coursework/tree/master/week1#intro-to-r) - might do like 30mins/day?

- Fill in solutions to `./citibike.R`

- [Cyclismo's](http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/index.html) more extensive tutorial (e.g. Distributions, Intermediate Plotting) -- SHORT ENOUGH, CAN BE DONE IN 1-2 DAYS

- Maybe the day after:
   - Read ch2 & 3 in R for Data Science, and think about how to generate Fig1 and 2 in The Anatomy of the Long Tail.
   - Hadley Wickham's [style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)

- WORTH CARE: [RStudo's ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)

- Spend 1-2 days trying out the materials under ["References"](https://github.com/msr-ds3/coursework/tree/master/week1#plotting), e.g.
  - RStudio's ggplot2 cheatsheet
  - Sean Anderson's slides
  - R Graphics Cookbook
  - Videos on visualizing data with ggplot2
  - _Optional: Official ggplot2 docs (not that long)_

## Work left from 12/10/2018 (Mon)

### Commandline tutorials:

- Pick up [CL crashcourse on "Learn Python the Hard Way"](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/ex10.html)
- Continue [here: _Learn more (optional)_](https://github.com/msr-ds3/coursework/tree/master/week1#learn-more-optional-1)
