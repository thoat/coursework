# the model fits quite well because the std. error is small. The elastity is abs(-1.60113), it is quite large i.e. the price is quite elastic i.e. people are quite sensitive to price change

# Add in an intercept term for each brand (add brand to the regression)
mymodel2 <- glm(formula = logmove ~ log(price) + brand, data = df)
summary(mymodel2)
# The price elasticity increases insignificantly. The std. error of the logprice feature also increases a bit. 

# Allow the elasticities to differ by brand. 
mymodel3 <- glm(formula = logmove ~ log(price) * brand, data = df)
summary(mymodel3)

# Hold out 20% of your sample randomly. Estimate the model on the remaining 80%. Use the predict command to see how well the model fits on the rest of the data (e.g. y_hat <- predict(my_model, newx = test_matrix))

spliter <- floor(0.8 * nrow(df))

# Impact of "featuring in store"
##################################
# Which brand is featured the most? Make a ggplot to show this. Hint: one way is to use position = "jitter", within the aes(color = factor(var_name)) of ggplot.
ggplot(df, aes(x = factor(feat), y = brand, color = brand)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter")  #creating a "crowd" around each point!!
# What is the average price and featured rate of each brand? Hint: aggregate(df[, x:y], list(df$var_name), mean) where x and y are the column numbers of the two variables you care about.
### One way:
detach(package:plyr)
df %>%
  group_by(brand) %>%
  summarize(avg_price = mean(price), featured_rate = mean(feat))

### Second way:
aggregate(df[, c("price","feat")], list(df$brand), mean)

# How should we incorporate the feature variable into our regression? Start with an additive formulation (e.g. feature impact sales, but not through price).
mymodel5 <- glm(data = df, formula = logmove ~ log(price) * brand + feat)
summary(mymodel5)

# Now run a model where features can impact sales and sale sensitivity. 
mymodel6 <- glm(data = df, formula = logmove ~ log(price) * brand * feat)
summary(mymodel6)

# Now add what you think are the most relevant sociodemographic controls and produce the regression results from that regression as well. 
mymodel7 <- glm(data = df, formula = logmove ~ log(price) * brand * feat * INCOME)
summary(mymodel7)

mymodel8 <- glm(data = df, formula = logmove ~ log(price) * feat + log(price) * brand + INCOME * brand)

## ==> Dominicks seems to have the most elastic demand, and Tropicana has the least.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
