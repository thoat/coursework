# Trees

Let's look at whether family background is a good predictor of SAT scores. Will all the predictors be used?

```{r sat_background}
sat <- read.csv("sat.csv", header=TRUE)
sat_taken = sat[sat$satobs==1,]
tree1 = rpart(sat~mlhs+flhs, data=sat_taken)
tree1
rpart.plot(tree1)
```

Now let's add in other test scores. Does family background still matter?

```{r sat_background_fam}
tree2 = rpart(sat~mlhs+flhs+matsc, data=sat_taken)
rpart.plot(tree2)
```
